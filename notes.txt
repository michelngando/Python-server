Install a virtual environmnent tool on the computer to "contain" flask and force python to install within the borders of the environment --> py -m pip install virtualenv
Use the virtual environmnet tool to create a virtual environmnent --> -m venv venv(the 2nd venv is a variable) --> The venv should be created within the project's folder
Activate the virtual env (venv) --> venv\Scripts\activate
It's recommended to use the venv for python's projects
Install Flask --> py -m pip install flask
Run the server (similar to running any python file): py filename.py
